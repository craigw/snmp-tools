Tools for working with SNMP
===========================

Create a pass_persist agent by doing this:

    require 'snmp-tools'

    # IMPORTANT! Get your own OID from IANA or you will break things!
    # It costs nothing and doesn't take very long.
    #   http://pen.iana.org/pen/PenApplication.page
    #
    enterprise_oid = ".1.3.6.1.4.1.NNNNN"

    # Pick a base OID which all the results here will live under.
    #
    base_oid = "#{enterprise_oid}.1.2.3"

    agent = Snmp::PassPersistAgent.new do |snmp|
      # For a simple query
      snmp.push(Snmp::Triple.new("#{base_oid}.4.5.6", "string", "1.2.54"))
      # For a query that will take longer to run you can pass a lambda.
      proc = proc {
        # ... SELECT COUNT * FROM uber_huge_table ...
      }
      snmp.push(Snmp::Triple.new("#{base_oid}.4.5.7", "integer", proc))
    end

    agent.run

Make sure the file containing this code is chmod +x. Test it like this:

  echo DUMP | /path/to/file

You should get a bunch of output containing the OIDs and the current values.

Now edit your snmpd.conf to include a line like this:

    pass_persist MIBOID /path/to/file

where MIBOID is the same as base_oid in the code above sans quotes. Restart 
your snmpd and you should be able to snmpwalk your base_oid.
